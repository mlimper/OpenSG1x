Before you build OpenSG make sure that the following requirements for 
your plattform are met :

Required Packages : 
===================

Plattform :
===========

    SGI (>= 6.5)
    ------------

        Compiler : > MIPS Pro 7.3.*
        Make     : > gmake 3.78.1
        glut     : 3.7

    Linux (so far only tested on RedHat > 7.0)
    -----

        Compiler : System compiler + 
                    patch gcc/RHBA-2000-132 and glibc/RHBA-2000-079.
        Make     : > gmake 3.78.1
        glut     : 3.7

    NT 
    -----------------

        During this first dynamic developments, where only infrequent builds 
        are done on NT, we do not use VisualStudio or some other
        IDE (of course only if you do not count emacs to be one :-)). So we 
        actually use gmake in combination with cygwin. So when you get a new
        gmake PLEASE DO NOT try to build it with native windows dev tools,
        use the gcc provided by cygwin instead. You can download an build the
        usual unix distribution using the cygwin environment. For OpenSG, 
        please do not try to use a microsoft compiler, even if there are 
        config files available. Believe us, it will fail and we are 
        working on it to find all the ways around their interpretation of
        doing C++ compilations.

        Compiler : Intel C++ > 4.5 + latest patchset
        Cygwin   : >= 1.1.4
        gmake    : >  gmake 3.78.1
        glut     : 3.7

        STL      : The current default is the original Microsoft 
                   implementation. Since there where some problems using
                   other implementations and the MSVC runtime libraries.

OpenSG Configuration :
======================

We actually have a lovely configure script now, but it's still a bit
experimental.

See using_configure on how to use it. Feedback on success
(or failure) welcome!


Documentation :
===============

##############################################################################
#### Since we just switched to configure this acutally does not work now #####
##############################################################################

And last, if you like it and want to get a deeper insight build the
documentation to get an overview over the different parts of the system. 
But be aware that the docuentation is by far not complete, it is ok to give
you an overview and browse through the structure but nothing more (Currently).

    make doc

This uses doxygen to create documentation in Doc/Code/html. We use
version 1.2.5, which is pretty new, but 1.2.0 should be ok, too. The
default configuration uses dot, so you need that, too, or you have turn
off the HAVE_DOT option.

There is a workaround for typedefed templates not showing up as classes.
It tricks doxygen into seeing classes that aren't there. So don't be
surprised if you see classes in the documentation that are not in the
code.
