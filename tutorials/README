  OpenSG Tutorial Examples
  ========================

These programs show you how to do things in OpenSG. They are not meant to be
complete applications, they rather demonstrate separate aspects of the
system and should be used as a starting point for your own tests and
experiments using OpenSG.

They are all based on the same framework, so you can interact with all of
them in the same way. The left mouse button rotates the scene, the
middle button translates, the right button (or both buttons on
two-button mice) zooms in or out.

The available examples are:

hello:                  The simplest OpenSG program. Just creates a torus.

move:                   How to use transformations.

share:                  Sharing the cores between different nodes.

geometry:               Simple non-indexed geometry node construction.

indexgeometry:          Using single indices for geometry.

multiindexgeometry:     Using multiple indices for different attributes.
