OpenSG Scene Viewer

A simple QT based scene viewer which allows the user to
explore the scene topologie and field values.

Needs QT 3.x and designer 2.x (part of QT 3.x). 

If you look for the ui-related code, it's not in *.cpp but
in *.ui.h. The whole application is created using the 
qt designer 2.x and the tool packes the slot code in *.ui.h.
