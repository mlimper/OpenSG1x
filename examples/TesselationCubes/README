GeoCubes
--------


This is a simple example of how to create "high level" nodes derived from
the Geometry node. If - for whatever reason - you want to create a
sophisticated high level Geometry nodecore, take a look at this source and
you should be able to base your own code on this.

The functionality is the same as the `Cubes' example, but instead of drawing
the cubes via direct OpenGL commands, this one "tessellates" them into an
(unoptimized) OpenSG Geometry, and uses Geometry's Render/Draw/Intersect
actions to automatically render them.
