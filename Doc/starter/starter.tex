\section{What is OpenSG}

OpenSG is a real-time rendering system based on a scenegraph metaphor.
It works along the lines of OpenInventor, Performer or Java3D, although
it is probably closest to Performer. It supports parallel processing,
albeit in a more general way, and will drive multiple displays for
multi-screen stereo projection systems. The goal is to have something
that handles multi-threaded data structures as simply as possible
without compromising performance too much. It should also support
heterogeneous multi-pipe applications, i.e. multiple different graphics
cards running one application. Many things are quite easy to do with
a little program, but are sometimes hard to fit into an existing system.
Thus accessibility is an important goal, and we're striving to make
OpenSG very extend-able.

It works on different Unix systems and Windows. 

It's primary use (i.e. what we are doing with it) is for VR applications,
mainly in the automotive context. But it can be used for any kind
of application needing fast and general 3D graphics. 


\section{What is OpenSG not}

OpenSG is not a complete VR system. Things like device access and
interaction are left out on purpose, there are other systems for that.
