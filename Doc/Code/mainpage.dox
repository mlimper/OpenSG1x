\mainpage OpenSG - The Open Source Scenegraph

Welcome to OpenSG. 

OpenSG is a scenegraph system for realtime rendering, e.g. for Virtual Reality
applications. It is just a library, not a full application.

This documentation contains descriptions of the internal classes and concepts,
as well as a tutorial that explains how to use the system.

The classes are easiest to find via the Class Hierarchy at the top of the
page. This is a pretty long list, a more structured approach can be made via
the Modules page.

The tutorial starts here: \ref Preface. It is organzied as the first part of 
the Related Pages section, and there are some other pages that are more of a 
description than a tutorial at the end of the Related Pages section.


\ext 

This documentation contains information about extending the system, i.e.
what to do when adding new classes to the system to make sure they are
registered in all the right places and integrate themselves seamlessly. 

\endext

\dev 

It also contains additional information that explains the internals and
how things work inside the library itself, for those who really need to know. 

\enddev

While we tried to make this documentation easy to understand and without
mistakes and errors, we're very interested in getting feedback on omissions,
improvement ideas or simply typos. Send them to info@opensg.org.
