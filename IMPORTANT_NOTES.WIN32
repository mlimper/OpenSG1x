Hi,

In order to work around some nasty bugs in Microsofts STL implementation 
(the one that ships with VS6) we will use the replacement xtree header from 
Dinkumware (http://www.dinkumware.com/xtree.txt) in the near future. 
Right now we did not switch the default case, as it might break quite some
setups out there, but we will do so soon.
As a consequence OpenSGs include path MUST be preceed Microsofts wherever
both are used.  If this is not the case undefined behaviour might be the 
result, though undefined we won't format your harddrive ;-)

If you encounter strange crashes, especially if maps are anywhere near, you 
might want to give it a try configuring OpenSG using --enable-fixed-xtree.

We'll try to figure out if these problems still persist in their lastest
release (the one shipping with VS7), more on that soon.

If you use VisualStudio.Net to build OpenSG or the prebuild libs from 
VisualStudio.Net, depending on your code unresolved symbols might occur. 
This is due to bugs in Microsofts compiler/linker which screw up to export
tables of the dll's build. If you build the libs on your own, just add the 
mangled symbol to FieldContainer/lib.def.sym and relink the dlls.
If you use the prebuild ones, you might try the libs build using intel's
icl compiler against the VisualStudio.Net runtime, and please drop us
a note, that we are able to include the symbol into the prebuild libs.

As I had not had the time to analyse all the circumstances under which 
the Microsoft tools decide to drop some symbols, and as mangled names
must be provided within the def files, I am currently not able to figure
out and insert all symbols that might be missing. One solution might
be to compare the icl dll against the vc7 ones and figure out the 
differences, I'll try this sooner or later  ;-).

Gerrit ;-)
