IMPORTANT IMPORTANT --- EXTERNAL TOOLS NEEDED --- IMPORTANT IMPORTANT


This directory contains the first version of out VStudio.NET support.
As I have not figured out if it is possible to reconfigure parts
on the fly you currently have to set up your VStudion the way that
all external used stuff is found as only local references are
used within these projects (see Requirements below). If not explicitly
stated the versions required by OpenSG are the ones you should use here
also.

WARNING WARNING WARNING

The dsp files are created by scripts, so if you intent to change/fix stuff
PLEASE do not only check in these changes/fixes, mail me 
(vossg@camtech.ntu.edu.sg) the original dsp file, the changed one and
a short hint what changed. Otherwise your changes/fixes might get LOST.

Current Requirements :

    You need to configure your VStudio to 

        find the glut headers and libs
        find the qt headers, libs and the moc executable
             there is a good chance that you have to patch the qt headers
             in order to get it working, just move the function definition
             into the class definition, worked for me

	To configure the path settings in VS7 go to Tools->Options.
	Open Projects->VC++ Directories and include the header/lib/bin
	path for glut/qt/...

    If you want to edit any .l or .y file or do a full rebuild your VStudio 
    additionally has to

        find a flex executable  (> version 2.5.4)
        find a bison executable (> version 1.30)

    In order to do the install process VStudio must be configured to find
    a sed.exe executable.

    The Windows GNU tools I use come from gnuwin32.sourceforge.net

What works :

    Currently only the debug and opt Libs could be build.

Further ahead :

    Add test cases
