This directory contains the first version of out VStudio6 support.
As I have not figured out if it is possible to reconfigure parts
on the fly you currently have to set up your VStudion the way that
all external used stuff is found as only local references are
used within these projects (see Requirements below). If not explicitly
stated the versions required by OpenSG are the ones you should use here
also.

WARNING WARNING WARNING

The dsp files are created by scripts, so if you intent to change/fix stuff
PLEASE do not only check in these changes/fixes, mail me 
(vossg@camtech.ntu.edu.sg) the original dsp file, the changed one and
a short hint what changed. Otherwise your changes/fixes might get LOST.

Current Requirements :

    You need to configure your VStudio to 

        use Intels icl compiler
        find the glut headers and libs
        find the tif headers and libs
        find the qt headers and libs and the moc executable
        find a flex executable (at least version 2.5.4)
        find a bison executable (at least version 1.30)

What works :

    Currently only the debug Libs could be build.

Near future :

    Add opt lib support

Further ahead :

    Add test cases
