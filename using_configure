How to use configure is quite straight forward. But be warned it is still
considered to be experimental. See ./configure --help for available options.

IMPORTANT NODE
If you created the links required by previous versions of the configure method
delete them and update again.

All platforms

cd <..../OpenSG>
autoconf

IRIX :

./configure --with-compiler=CC --with-stl=<stl-dir>
		    --with-qt=<qt-dir> --with-glut=<glut-dir>
			--prefix=<install-dir>
cd Builds/mips-sgi-irix6.5-CC
gmake


CYGWIN (ICL4.5, including patch P000223C, P000421C, p000512c, P000616C)
       (ICL5.0)

bash ./configure --with-compiler=icl45 --with-qt=<qtdir> --with-glut=<glut-dir>
                 --prefix=<install-dir>

cd Build/i686-pc-cygwin-icl45
make


Linux (RH 7.0, including patch gcc/RHBA-2000-132, glibc/RHBA-2000-079) 

./configure --with-compiler=g++ --with-glut --with-qt=<qtdir>
			--prefix=<install-dir>
cd Build/i686-pc-linux-g++
make

----
General parameters : 

	--prefix=<install-dir>

		sets the install directory where OpenSG will be installed. If set
		to BUILD the Builds/<system> directory will be used. Defaults to
		/usr/local

To make the system:

cd Builds/<system>
gmake
(build BaseLib and SystemLib)
you need to add BaseLib/lib-dbg and SystemLib/lib-dbg to your library path
as an alternative you can do gmake install and add lib/dbg to your path.

to make a test program
cd SystemTest
make testWindowGLUT
./testWindowGLUT ../../../Loader/dino.raw


To make the VRML Loader test program you need to be in SystemTest and
ln -s ../../../Experimental/VRMLLoader/std.wrl .
make testVRMLRender
./testVRMLRender ../../../Experimental/VRMLLoader/tie.wrl
