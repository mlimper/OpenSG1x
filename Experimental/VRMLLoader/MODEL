The TIE fighter model was taken from the AC3D website (www.ac3d.org),
which lists its origin as 'found on the web as VRML'. As it's been
distributed as part of AC3D for quite a while now, we think that it's ok
to use it as a simple test model.

If it's yours and you have a problem with that, tell us and we'll find
something else. Even though I really like it... ;)
