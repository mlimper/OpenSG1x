    configure: local extensions, separate include/lib dirs, 
    GL: wrapper header for GL/GLUT/extensions
    Clustering
    Binary File format: relatively compact files, extremely fast load
    Particle NodeCore
    Text: for statistics only right now, not on Windows, needs Freetype1
    Statistics: pretty general statistics collector
    Geometry: secondary color & multi-texture support, better pumps for
              dynamic geometry, new striper, LatLongSphere
    State: CubeTexture, 3D Texture, Register Combiners support
    Name: convenience functions to create/read/remove name attachments

    CameraDecorators: ShearedStereo, Projection
    StereoBufferViewport
    
CHANGED:
    FieldContainer:
        Reference Counting for Nodes
            Uses standard automatic method now, thus no need for unlinkSubTree 
            and friends any more, standard subRef is enough.
    Functors:
        For .NET we needed to dumb down the functors, so now the are split up
        into  anumber of classes that you need to choose the right version
        from.
    Thread:
        run -> runFunction
    get/set/addValue() interface for MFields:
        This interface is now deprecated. Please use th STL vector interface
        instead.
    ChangeMode enum replaced by UInt32
        If you have created your own FieldContainers, you will have to do this
    Fixed inlining for FCPtr and other low-level structures
    VRMLTransform -> ComponentTransform
    State: split texgen from TextureChunk into TexGenChunk
    Multi-Thread Safe GL object handling
    Window::WinID -> Window::Id
    
REMOVED:
    bool:
        we removed our own Bool type and replaced it by std::bool
    String:
        same for String, use std::string instead

1.0 - 2001/10/18

    initial version, nothing changed yet. :)
