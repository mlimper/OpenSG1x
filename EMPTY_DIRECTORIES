Empty Directories or What bugs me about CVS
===========================================

If you see a large number of empty directories in the OpenSG source tree
you've found one of the problems of CVS. If you want to get rid of  them, just
use the '-P' option to cvs checkout or cvs update.

CVS allows you to go back to any old version of the tree. It mirrors the
directory structure in the repository and thus to be able to access old files
it needs the original directories. As a consequence, you can't remove
directories. 

You can use -P on checkout or update, or add it to your ~/.cvsrc file. That's
the only thing we can do. Sorry for the confusion.
