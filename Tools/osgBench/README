These are the humble beginnings of a benchmarking system for OpenSG

The idea was to have a Python wrapper around some core functions
that would simplify setting up test scene (similar to what GLscry does,
but a lot less fancy ;).

It's borderline useable, but not complete by any means.

Use at your own risk!
