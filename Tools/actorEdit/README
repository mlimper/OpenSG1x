 ** OpenSG actorEdit README

actorEdit is a small tool that is used to generate c++ code from an actor
description file (.acd). It is quite similar to fcdEdit for FieldContainers,
in case you are familiar with that.

There are two programs here actually. actorEdit is the commandline only version
that writes the c++ code files from a given description file.
The following options are accepted:

 -a         write the actor code file.
            This is a quite minimal file to which you can make your own
            modifications.

 -b         write the actor base code file.
            This generates the files ending in Base.{cpp, h, inl} which contain
            most of the generated code. Changes here will be lost, when the file
            is regenerated, which could become necessary at any time.

 -f         force overwrite of actor code files.
            Normally actor code files are not overwritten, but instead a
            message asks you to remove the files first. With this option the
            actor code files are always written, any modifications to these
            files will be lost.
            (Note that actor base code files are always overwritten).

 -p path    write the generated files to path instead of the current directory.
            (Note that there is no sanity checking performed on the path,
            so please be careful with your input).

 -h         print a short help message.

The second program is actorEditGui and presents the user with a QT graphical
user interface. It allows to generate actor description files in relative
comfort and can also generate the c++ code files.

 ** Dependencies
 **

actorEdit requires the OpenSG Base library libOSGBase.so or dll.
actorEditGui also requires the System and WindowQT library, the latter depending
on QT, of course.
