Description:

The LinearCombinerGeometry adds a new kind of NodeCore which can efficiently
interpolate between a number of different position sets and combine them given
a set of weights. This effect is commonly called morphing, even though that's a
pretty undefined term. 

There are some convenience functions to create an LCG from a set of Geometries,
see the example for details. 

Note that the LCG does not attempt to solve the point correspondence problem:
all the different versions of the model have to have the same number of
vertices, and they all have to be in the same order, i.e. the interpolation
will always be between the nth element of the arrays, no matter where they are
located.

Note also that the normals are not recalculated or interpolated. For small
motions that's ok and will probably not be visible. If you use large motions
you will have to recalculate or interpolate the normals, though.

Enjoy!
