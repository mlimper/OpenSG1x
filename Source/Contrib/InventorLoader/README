Description:

This is an early version of an Open Inventor loader. It uses the Open Source
OpenInventor libraries (available at http://oss.sgi.com/projects/inventor/) to
load the file and converts the nodes it knows about to the corresponding
OpenSG nodes afterwards. Currently the supported Inventor nodes are Material,
Coordinate3, NormalBinding, Normal, Transform, IndexedFaceSet, Separator and
Group. The support is probably not complete, but it's good enough to load a 
variety of Inventor files.

You might be able to run it using the GPL Coin lib (www.coin3d.org), but we 
haven't tried that yet.

It's rather simple to extend this loader to become more complete, just add 
the cases you need to the type dispatcher. We would be happy to accept any extensions
you can come up with.
