Description:

This is a PLY loader based on Greg Turk's code. The reason this is not
in the core is the license, which doesn't allow commercial use. Other than
that it's pretty functional and loads all the usual models.

If you want to add this to your standard system (because you don't intend
to  sell your software anyway) you can just copy this directory into
Source/System/FileIO and rename common.libs.in.system to common.libs.in.  On
Windows you also have to change the OSG_CONTRIBLIB_DLLMAPPING in
OSGPLYSceneFileType.h to OSG_SYSTEMLIB_DLLMAPPING. After a reconfigure and
compile your programs should be able to load .ply files.
