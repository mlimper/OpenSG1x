    I compiled it with cg 1.3 beta but nvidia removed this version I hope it works also

Configure:

This is just an example you need to modify the cg paths.

./configure <your standard options> --with-add-incdir=/usr/software/cg/include --with-add-libdir=/usr/software/cg/lib --with-add-lib=Cg:CgGL:CgFXParser


Have fun
