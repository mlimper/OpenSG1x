Description:

FTGL is a simple wrapper around the FTGL font rendering library. It can
display text in a number of different ways inside OpenSG. This code was
whipped up pretty quickly as an immediate stopgap to cover the time until
the text is redesigned. Therefore it's not complete and probably has a bunch
of problems.

Known problems:

- This probably won't work on Windows right now. Non-library FieldContainers 
  with Fields haven't been done before. 

- Texture and Bitmap rendering don't work. The OpenGL commands seem to be
  sensible, but the output is just wrong.

Configure:

./configure <your standard options> \
--with-add-incdir=/usr/include/freetype2:<wherever you have ftgl headers> \
--with-add-libdir=<wherever you have ftgl libs> --with-add-lib=ftgl:freetype

Have fun

    Dirk
