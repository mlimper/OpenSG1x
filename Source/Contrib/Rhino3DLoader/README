Description:

This is a relatively fully featured loader for OpenNURBS (or Rhino3D, .3dm)
files. The loader supports some extra features not found in "standard"
OpenSG loaders, take a look at the testRhino3DRender.cpp file to see
how to use them.

What works:

- loading of trimmed NURBS patches
- curves
- meshes (basic support)
- materials

What doesn't work:

- topology is discarded (no support in OpenSG and unfortunately it won't
  be supported anytime soon :( )
- textures (coming)
- rendermesh support (coming)
- groups/layers/instances/visibility (coming)

In order to actually load Rhino3D files, it needs the OpenNURBS library
to be installed. The library is available from http://www.opennurbs.org.
When configuring OpenSG, the path to the OpenNURBS library and headers
must be specified. The headers are expected under a subfolder called
opennurbs. You should call configure like:

./configure  <your usual options> \
--with-add-incdir=/path/to/openNURBS-headers \
--with-add-libdir=/path/to/openNURBS-lib --with-add-lib=openNURBS

I don't know how to pass these options with the scons build, sorry.
