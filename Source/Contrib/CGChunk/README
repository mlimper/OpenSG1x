Description:

The CGChunk is a StateChunk to integrate nVidia's CG library into OpenSG. It is
relatively simple and not full-featured, but it's a start, you're welcome to
make it more complete. ;)

It just keeps the vertex and fragment program in strings and manages the
context.

Configure:

This is just an example you need to modify the cg paths.

./configure <your standard options> --with-add-incdir=/usr/software/cg/include --with-add-libdir=/usr/software/cg/lib --with-add-lib=cg:cgGL


Have fun
