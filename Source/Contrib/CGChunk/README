Description:

The CGChunk is a StateChunk to integrate nVidia's CG library into OpenSG. It is
relatively simple and not full-featured, but it's a start, you're welcome to
make it more complete. ;)

It just keeps the vertex and fragment program in strings and manages the
context, but always uses the ARB_FP1 and ARB_VP1 profiles for portability.

Have fun
