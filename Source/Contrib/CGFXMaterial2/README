Description:

A material for cgfx (version >= 1.4)

Configure:

This is just an example you need to modify the cg paths.

./configure <your standard options> --with-add-incdir=/usr/software/cg/include --with-add-libdir=/usr/software/cg/lib --with-add-lib=Cg:CgGL


Have fun

-------------------
Addition (2008-10-07):

There are some Cg shader fragments in directory shaderfragments
which will install in <OpenSGIncludeDir>/shaderfragments.

A minimal example of how to use them can be found in
test_shaderfragments.cpp and test_shaderfragments.cgfx.
