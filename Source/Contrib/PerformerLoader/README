Description:

This is a simple converter from Performer to OpenSG. It loads a model into
Performer and then traverses the graph, converting nodes into OpenSG. It
works reasonably well, but it's not complete. It's primarily focused on
converting polygonal geometry, and given Performer's indexing system there
might be cases where it doesn't work, but it's a start. The following node
types are recognizedand converted: Group, LOD (see below), SCS, DCS, Geode.
Unknown Groups are handled as Groups. The Geode handling is probably
incomplete, the handling of flat primitives doesn't work too well, and it
probably doesn't work with some of the more modern Geometry storage options
of Performer (like GArrays). The GeoState handling ignores quite a lot of
things (like light models, lights, vertex/fragment programs, cube textures
etc.)

By default it ignores Level of Detail nodes and only keeps the highest LOD.
This can be fixed by setting the corresponding flag in the SceneFileType.

What can I say, it's a start.
