Description:

The DrawFunctorCore is a workaround helper class for those cases where you want
to quickly add some drawing to the graph, but don't have the time or
inclination to write a new NodeCore. It keeps two functors, one for bounding
volume calculation, one for actual OpenGL drawing.

It is not part of the core because it doesn't handle any multi-thread safety
issues and consequently doesn't work across a cluster. So it's ok to use it for
quick tests, but for serious apps I strongly recommend against it! Come on,
write a NodeCore, using fcdEdit it's simple enough! ;)

Yours
