Statistics contains general facilities for recording and collecting 
statistical data like counts and times. It is mainly used for collecting 
rendering statistics like the amount of time need for a frame or the number of 
visible polygons, but it can be used for any kind of statistics.

The statistics data is collected in the form of single osg::StatElem
structures  which are bundled in a osg::StatCollector. Every StatElem element
can have one of a  number of different types, the predefined ones are Int
(osg::StatIntElem), Real32 (osg::StatRealElem), Time (osg::StatTimeElem) and
String (osg::StatStringElem). Every StatElement also has a description in the
form of a StatElemDesc  that describes the actual use of the element. The
StatCollector can hold an  arbitrary subset of all known elements. The
StatElemDesc obj holding the element type and ID must exist as long as any
collector holds a corresponding elem object. The StatElemDesc  constructor
creates a unique ID which can be used to create/access an correspondent Elem
(which holds the value) in any collector.

The contents of the StatCollector can be accessed either for every StatElem 
separately or can be output as a whole in the form of a string. For
displaying  the contents of a StatCollector on screen the
osg::SimpleStatisticsForground and  osg::GraphicStatisticsForeground can be
used.  The various StatElem objects provide methods to access or change the
value (e.g get/set increase/decrease) In addition, every StatElem holds a
on-flag to activate/deactivate the statistic element.

The main idea of the Statistics structure lies in high flexibility. Thus the
set of variables that are statistically relevant is not fixed, new ones can be
added by the application if necessary.

To extend the Statistics you just need to create an instance of the 
osg::StatElemDesc class. It is templated and parametrized by the osg::StatElem
that the new variable should have.
