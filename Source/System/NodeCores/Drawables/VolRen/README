This directory contains a volume rendering library for OpenSG.


Revision:

Date:    10/07/2003
Version: This is a 0.95 beta - try at your own risk.
	 (The interfaces might still change occationally)


Revision History:
0.9 beta	10/10/2003	initial version
0.95 beta	10/07/2003	more sophisticated shading modes
                                exploiting in particular 
                                ARB_fragment_program capability
				support for volume clipping

Compatibility:

The current library requires the OpenSG-1.2.0 version.  However there
is a known bug in the OpenSG-1.2.0 release which makes the
DVRIsoShader crash when run in FragmentShader mode. It is due to an
error in the deletion of the ProgramChunk. To fix this you might want
to comment out the "destroyGLObject" call in the destructor of
ProgramChunk.

Previous versions of the OpenSG library a not longer supported due to
an interface change in osg::Image.

However we are not testing compatibility with the Snapshot every
day so try it on your own risk.


Build:

The VolRen-Lib is fully integrated with the OpenSG build tree.  So in
order to build just checkout the module VolRen in the OpenSG source
tree and then configure, make should do.

The designated position of the volume library is:

	<osg-root>/Source/System/VolRen


How to use:

There are several test and demo programs demonstrating the use and
the functionality of the volume rendering library:

    testClipObjectsRender
    testMtexLUTShaderRender
    testSimpleVolumeNodeRender
    testIsoShaderRender
    testSimpleLUTShaderRender
    testVolumeShadersRender

The demos require the that the data file included in the distribution
can be found in the current directory. So take care of that.
