    ==================================
    OpenSG - an Open Source Scenegraph
    ==================================

Version  1.1.0, 2002/07/02

Note that this is a development version, which means that we mainly added 
features/fixed bugs, but didn't put a lot of effort into documentation or
examples. It also means that some parts of the API might still change. Due 
to the amount of bugfixes etc we still recommend using this version over the 
stable 1.0.

    What is it / will it be?
    ------------------------

OpenSG is a realtime rendering system based on a scenegraph metaphor. It
works along the lines of OpenInventor, Performer or Java3D, although it is
probably closest to Performer. It supports parallel processing, albeit in
a more general way, and will drive multiple displays for multi-screen
stereo projection systems. The goal is to have something that handles
multi-threaded data structures as simply as possible without compromising
performance too much. It should also support heterogenous multi-pipe
applications, i.e. multiple different graphics cards running one
application. Many things are quite easy to do with a little program, but
are sometimes hard to fit into an existing system. Thus extendibility is
an important goal, and we're striving to make OpenSG very extendable.

It works on different Unix systems and Windows. 

It's primary use (i.e. what we are doing with it) is for VR applications,
mainly in the automotive context. But it can be used for any kind of
application needing fast and general 3D graphics. It is, however, not a
complete VR system. Things like device access and interaction are left out
on purpose, there are other systems for that.


    How do I use it?
    ----------------

See INSTALL for instructions how to build it. After you're done, see
tutorials for some examples how to use it. Documentation is in Doc/, but
it is not built by default. You can either build it by calling make doc
or download it from www.opensg.org.



So take a look, enjoy, and tell us what you think!

Yours
