This direcory contains the code for using FTGL inside OpenSG.

FTGL can't be used directly, as its managing of OpenGL objects interferes 
with OpenSG's. You need to patch FTGL, until (maybe) the changes I made are
integrated into the FTGL core. The patch file is ftgl.patch, and it is
designed for FTGL 2.0.9. I wouldn't expect there to be problems with other
versions, as the changes are in an area that is unlikely to change.

Once you have the patched FTGL in place you can just the FTGLFont and
FTGLText classes to display text, see testText.cpp for an example.


This code was whipped up pretty quickly as an immediate stopgap to cover
the time until the text is redesigned. Therefore it's not complete and
probably has a bunch of problems.

Known problems:

- This probably won't work on Windows right now. Non-library FieldContainers 
  with Fields haven't been done before. 

- Texture and Bitmap rendering don't work. The OpenGL commands seem to be
  sensible, but the output is just wrong.
