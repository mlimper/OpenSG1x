WHAT YOU NEED TO COMPILE THIS

-VS.NET 2003 or Linux
-DirectX 9.0 or Video for Linux (V4L)
-ARToolKit Plus (from http://studierstube.org/handheld_ar/artoolkitplus.php)
 or ARToolKit (from http://www.hitl.washington.edu/artoolkit)
-a videosource (webcam...)
-a piece of paper with a hiro pattern printed on it (print patt_hiro.png)
-the file test.wrl (should be here somewhere)
-the file camera_para.dat (should be here somewhere)

ARToolKit Plus doesn't compile on Linux in the current form. artkp.patch is
a patch that fixes some problems that gcc has with it. It is for version
1.3.1, and may not work for other versions. To use it you also need to link
MemroyManager.cpp into your project.

There is a #define in main.cpp to switch between ARToolkit Plus and
ARToolKit. Please set it accordingly.

This is primarily an example of how to combine OpenSG and
ARToolKit Plus, and it doesn't aspire to be the best possible AR
application. ;)
