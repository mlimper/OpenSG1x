Example for adding new types to OpenSG
======================================

This directory contains example code for adding new types to OpenSG. See the
online docs or the Starter Guide, pages/sections "Creating New Field Types"
and "Creating New FieldContainer Types" for a description of the topics
involved. Note that these sections are only included in the developer versions of
the docs/Starter Guide.

This example shows 4 different things:

- how to create a new Field type to be used in an application
   (OSGNewFieldType.*)
   
- how to create a new Field type to be used in a library
   (OSGNewFieldTypeLib.*)

- how to create a new FieldContainer type to be used in an application
   (OSGNewFieldContainer.*)
   
- how to create a new FieldContainer type to be used in a library
   (OSGNewFieldContainerLib.*)


OSGMyLibraryDef.h is a helper file needed for the library variants.
testTypes.cpp is a little program that creates instances of the new types and
tests some of their capabilities.

The Makefile is a standard minimal OpenSG makefile that uses the OSGROOT
variable to define the place where OpenSG is installed and tries to run off a
Builds/* install if it is not set.

If you have problems take a look at the documentation, if there are still
questions contact us at feedback@opensg.org.

Enjoy!
