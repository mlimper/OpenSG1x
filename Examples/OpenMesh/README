OpenMesh example
================

This is an example for how to use OpenMesh in conjunction with OpenSG.

OpenMesh is an OpenSource computational geometry library available from www.openmesh.org. From the webpage:

"OpenMesh is a generic and efficient data structure for representing and manipulating polygonal meshes. OpenMesh is developed at the Computer Graphics Group, RWTH Aachen , as part of the OpenSGPlus project, is funded by the German Ministry for Research and Education (BMBF), and will serve as geometry kernel upon which the so-called high level primitives (e.g. subdivision surfaces or progressive meshes) of OpenSGPlus are built. 
It was designed with the following goals in mind :

Flexibility : provide a basis for many different algorithms without the need for adaptation. 
Efficiency : maximize time efficiency while keeping memory usage as low as possible. 
Ease of use : wrap complex internal structure in an easy-to-use interface."

It features a pretty flexible Mesh concept, that allows building meshes that can be used to directly interact with OpenSG data.

This is a simple example that uses OpenMesh to decimate a loaded model. Note that the model is loaded via OpenMesh, thus only the OpenMesh loaders are supported. Try the dolphins.obj from the Tutorials, or any other .obj model.

OpenMesh uses its own build system, which is not very integration-friendly. Thus you can either use the OpenMesh buildsystem, or you have to copy the OpenMesh-specific make options into the example Makefile.
