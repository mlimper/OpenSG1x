This directory contains an example project to show the usage of the QT Designer
widget plugin.

The osgdesignerexampleform.ui is generated with the QT Designer and contains 
a form showing off the QT Designer plugin.

The osgdesignerexample.pro file can be used with qmake to create a Makefile
for the project like this:
qmake osgdesignerexample.pro

(This project file is tested under Linux and works perfectly there. 
Spending hours on stupid path adjustments on the Windoze platform i resigned,
thus the project file is not meant to be used under that platform.)
