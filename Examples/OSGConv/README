This is a simple command-line converter program.

Its purpose is to load a model in one of the supported formats, do some
conversions/optimizations on it, and store it in on of the supported formats.

Just run osg-conv without arguments to see a list of options.

It's simple but absolutely functional. Its biggest weakness right now is the
hard-coded GraphOp set, which hinges on fixing the string interface to
GraphOpSeq. Once that's fixed, this program does all it's supposed to do
(unless you can find something that it should do but doesn't, add it and send
me a patch ;).

Thanks to Jan Springer for the contribution!

Yours
